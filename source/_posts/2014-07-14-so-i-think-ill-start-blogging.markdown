So I've decided that I'd like to start blogging.  This will serve as a vehicle 
for all my thoughts, as well as any interesting things that I dig up on the 
Internet. But first a bit about myself.

I'm Alan Jones, a information security guy who's not a rock star.  I get paid 
to hack stuff (legally), which is a pretty damn cool job.
